## DoRothEA (v1)
Currently the scripts to run DoRothEA are not wrapped up in an R package. Therefore no installation is required.

## DoRothEA (v2)
DoRothEA is dependent on the R package [viper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/viper.html). To install viper start R and enter

```
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("viper")
```
