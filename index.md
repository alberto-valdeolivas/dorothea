# DoRothEA

## Overview
DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) is a manually curated human regulon to estimate single sample transcription factor (TF) activities from gene expression data and consensus TF-target DNA binding networks. The approach assumes that the activity of a TF can be estimated from the mRNA levels of its direct target genes. We provide two versions of DoRothEA.
### DoRothEA (v1)
The first version of DoRothEA consists of 127 TFs targeting in total 7,445 genes. If you use this regulon please cite

### DoRothEA (v2)
This new version of DoRothEA provides updated TF regulons derived from a broader collection of resources and strategies. The new TF regulons are signed (to account for activation/repression), when possible, and each TF-target interaction has been assigned a confidence score, ranging from A-E, being A the most confident interactions (see table below).

| Confidence score  | #TFs  | #Targets | #Interactions |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| A                 | 94    | 2,530     | 5,156         |
| B                 | 21    | 997       | 1,188         |
| C                 | 174   | 3,324     | 7,422         | 
| D                 | 94    | 6,050     | 11,038        |
| E                 | 1,013 | 19,003    | 445,907       |
| Total             | 1,396 | 20,238    | 470,701       |

## Outlook
Currently we are trying to infer mouse regulons from the human regulons. [Drop us a line](mailto:cholland2408@gmail.com) if you are interested in the progress. More information coming soon...
