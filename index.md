# DoRothEA

## Overview
DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) is a manually curated human regulon to estimate single sample transcription factor (TF) activities from gene expression data and consensus TF-target DNA binding networks. The approach assumes that the activity of a TF can be estimated from the mRNA levels of its direct target genes. We provide two versions of DoRothEA
### DoRothEA (v1)
The first version of DoRothEA consists of 127 TFs targeting in total 7,445 genes. If you use this regulon please cite

### DoRothEA (v2)
This new version of DoRothEA provides updated TF regulons derived from a broader collection of resources and strategies. The new TF regulons are signed (to account for activation/repression), when possible, and accompanied by a confidence score. You can find the preprint of the publication on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/03/337915)

## Outlook
Currently we are trying to infer mouse regulons from the human regulons. [Drop us a line](mailto:cholland2408@gmail.com) if you are interested in the progress. More information coming soon...
